## Project Overview

The **Drum Kits** project is an interactive, browser-based drum kit that allows users to simulate playing real drum sounds. With this project, you can either click on the drum pads or use specific keyboard keys to produce sounds such as snare, bass, cymbals, and toms. The sounds are triggered using JavaScript's audio features, creating a smooth, real-time audio experience for users.

This project is designed to be responsive, ensuring that users can play the drum kit on various devices.

## Features
